//TODO for the elemental ones spawn block structures under the player's feet. Maybe they could have two stages targets, like one where they attack and one where they defend. FOr example, summoning a wall of thin ice to protect an allay from direct hit. Like some kinda ice which has low durability and shatters easly and melts afeter a few seconds. This could be done for the other elements as well.
