### LightCharges
This is the primary feature added by this release. LightCharges will allow you to activate your light whenever you want! Sort of.

- You will be able to get and use LightCharges after you have triggred your light normally at least once. 
- Every player has maximum number of charges that they can store at a given time, and it ranges from 0-8 (or 1-7, see the config). 
- You can use a charge by pressing the same button you use to activate it, by default it's **V**. Using a charge will set you in a "light-ready" status, press the activation button again to activate your light. You can't automatically recover a charge you have used, so make sure to activate your light as well! Or, harvest it with a Empty bottle to get the BottledLight back.
- An icon will also appear showing how many light charges you currently have. Also, the more light chargese you have stored, the more you will glow. When you have max light charges you will also emit some light particles.
- Using a light charge is more costly for your light, and will increase the cooldown time by quite a lot!
- Getting a charge is a complicated and somewhat expensive process. You will need to get a BottledLight, an item that stores InnerLight energy in a bottle. You can use this item with a right click, and after the bottle breaks you will have obtained one light charge. You will also be put in a temporary cooldown.
- To get the BottledLight there are two ways: The first and simpler one is using an empty bottle when your light is ready. This will make a BottledLight store your own InnerLight, and only you will be able to use it. The other way is the alchemist way, you will be able to brew some of it by using an Experience Bottle and crushed luxintus berry, which you can obtain by smashing an anvil on top a luxintus berry. Be warned! May explode!. After that, you will need to insert the ingredients associated to the desidere light type and target. Every player with the same type and target will be able to use these. But if you have a different light type, please refrain from trying to use it!
