Updated to 1.20.1
Updated Renderer library

Now the low health checks a new way to ""predict"" how much damage will be recoved next (takes into account armor, status effects, and attacks speed), and if it is under the designated health percentage it will tick. (new way of triggering the light below)
Compatibility with:
    - Open parties and claims
    - Factions (dependency updated, no substantial changes, fixed the fact that now it's an samef || alliedf instead of samef && alliedf
    - Argonauts, both parties and guilds
    - FTBTeams

Renamed the OTHER targetype to VARIANT

Now the drowneds summoned with the Aqua light will never attack the player who summoned them, not even after the light runs out, but they will attack everyone else even during the day

(The armor and surrounded can be toggled for the count in the config. It is advised to set them on true)
Overhauled the way the lights triggers. Now there are a number of factors that allow a player to trigger a light. If enough of this factors are present, it will trigger
For the Blazing light:
- These factor have different weights, but they are:
  ALL: Low health, Very Low Health, Blazing conditions, being surrounded, low armor
  ENEMIES: same, + low armor of the armor of the allies
For the Heal light:
- Again different weights:
    SELF: Low health, Very low health, Poisend, low armor
    ALLIES: Allies low health, surrounded, allies low armor, allies poisoned
    VARIANT: Peaceful/Self/Allies low health, same + harmful status effect
For Defense light:
    SELF: Low health, Very low health, low armor, surrounded (for example, here it triggers with very low health only, or a combination of low health and either low armor or surrounded)
    ALLIES: ALlies low health, allies low armor, very low health (self), surrounded
    VARIANT: VARIANT low health (yes it's the only parameter)
For Strength light:
    SELF/VARIANT: Low health, Very low health, low armor, surrounded
    ALLIES: Allies low health, self very low health, allies low armor, surrounded
For Blazing light:
    - **`ENEMIES`**: `Very low Health`, `Low armor durability`, `Ally low armor durability`, `Surrounded`, `Blazing conditions`
    - **`ALL`**: `Low Health`, `Very low Health`, `Low armor durability`, `Surrounded`, `Blazing conditions`
    - VARIANT: Same as enemies
For frost light:
    ALL: Low health, very low health, surrunded, low armor, Frost conditions (for exmaple, frost conditions+low health triggers)
    ENEMIES: Self Very low health, Allies low health, frost conditions, ally low armor,  self low armor, surrounded
    SELF: Low health, very low health, surrounded low armor, frost conditions
    ALLIES: Allies low health, very low health (self),  frost conditions, allies low armor, surrounded.
For Earthen light:
    VARIANT: Ally low health, very low health self, earthen conditions, surrounded
    ENEMIES: same as VARIANT (the weights vary tho)
    SELF: Very low health, low health, surrounded, earthen conditions
    ALLIES: Ally low health, self very low health, earthen conditions, surrounded (again, weights vary)
For Wind light:
    VARIANT: TODO subject to change: Very low health, surrounded, falling from a small height, falling from a higher height, wind conditions
    SELF: Low health, Very low health, big fall, small fall, wind conditins, surrounded
    ALLIES: allies low health, self very low health, surrounded, self falling (10 blocks), wind conditions, allies falling (20 blocks TODO maybe change),
For Aqua light:
    ALL: very low health, low armor, surrounded, aqua conditions
    ENEMIES: very low health, low health, low armor, surrounded, aqua conditions
    SELF: very low health, low health, low armor, surrounded, aqua conditions
    ALLIES: allies low health, self very low health, surrounded, low armor, aqua conditions
For Frog light: quite low health/surrounded (one of the two)

Frost light:

The ENEMIES & ALL targets have been changed. Now they will be encased in a box of clear ice, and internnaly,
won't change looking direction anymore, and will not be able to attack or break blocks and will no longer be invisible.
Unless they have freeze resistance.

Added a new block, Clear Ice. It melts/breaks into a puff of snow and is more translucent than normal ice.
It is also non-solid, meaning it doesn't do suffocating damage. Like glass.
(Now the statues are no longer supported, but still present for creative decoration)
It behaves similarly to frosted ice unless a player is present.

Wind Light:
The checkWind now only checks for standard AIR, not CAVE_AIR or VOID_AIR. Since wind isn't supposed to be there most of the time.

Added new triggers:
- Fall Trigger, when a living entity (aka player or mob) falls it triggers a check for a light (not necessarly triggering it). The minimum for firing is 5 blocks
- Burn Trigger, when an entity is on fire
- Freeze Trigger, when an entity is freezing
- Drowning Trigger, when an entity is drowning

(separated the checkLights into anVARIANT class from LightTriggeringAndEvents)

Fixed a bug with the /reroll duration not working correctly and always giving the lowest amount.
Fixed a similar bug, where using /light reroll cooldown would use a random power instead.

Now the duration is better controllable using the config setting, and the duration of all the lights has been extended using the multiplier.
Now the base values range from 1 to 16, and the default multiplier is 1.3. You can also adjust for low values in the config.

Added /light reroll all command to reroll every aspect of the light

Changed how the light types,targets,duration,cooldown,power ecc are determined so your default light might have changed.
(You will be keeping your current light unless you use /light reset).
Fixed an issue for determing the target type.

Luxmutua berry now changes the target too. (I thought it did already, don't really remember, it's been like a year)

Changed some Luxcognita messages, and some activation messages

Now by default, allies need to be below their HP percentage (config) in order to recive any buff from the triggering of
a player. This can be brought back to always getting a buff in the config file. (Same thing for pets and such)


Updated the Heal light VARIANT target:
- Now instead of targeting "peaceful creatures" it instead targets everyone and removes harmful status effects (except the Light Fatigue!)
Updated the STRENGTH light VARIANT target:
- Now instead of targeting "peaceful creatures" it instead targets self and gives increased attacks speed!


Added suggestion providers for select a new light type / target as well

Added an option to "Lock" a light, aka not being able to activate it from the get-go, but needing a command or eating a luxintus berry.
By default this option is not active. You can still manually lock someone's light.

Now the caster of a light with the ALLIES target will recive only a partial bonus from the effect, configurable from the config.

Fixed Strength light using wrong max/min values

Added option to set permissions, check the permissions.txt file on github!
Added option to consider non ALLIES as ENEMIES

Restructured the config completely :}

Blazing light has a new target: Variant
Identical to ENEMIES, but soul flame themed.

Updated the AQUA light ENEMIES target: Now instead of weird cages of mangrove roots the enemies will be launched
into the air by a water column/geyser, hitting a trident (which is not pickup-able anymore) if the power level is high enough.
