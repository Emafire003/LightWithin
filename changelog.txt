Fixed a bug with runes rendering not showing up anymore.
Added Light Charges, which allow the player to ready their light whenever they want, provided they have enough charges.
They go from 0-9 before glitching currently. If a player attempts to use a light charge even if they don't have enough charges

The items crushed by an anvil will have an increased chance of exploding if the anvil is dropped from a height

The player now glows like a glow squid if light charges are stored, and when they meet the max count, they will also produce some light particles
