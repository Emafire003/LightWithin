Fixed a bug with runes rendering not showing up anymore.
Added Light Charges, which allow the player to ready their light whenever they want, provided they have enough charges.
They go from 0-9 before glitching currently. If a player attempts to use a light charge even if they don't have enough charges

The items crushed by an anvil will have an increased chance of exploding if the anvil is dropped from a height

The player now glows like a glow squid if light charges are stored, and when they meet the max count, they will also produce some light particles
AUTO_LIGHT_ACTIVATIOn in the main one now is used to allow or disallow
players from auto activating their light
Removed unused settings from the main Config file, and moved them to the client one
