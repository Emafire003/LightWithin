# Light Within Mod

## So... What does it do?

This mod adds a new mechanic, called *"InnerLights"* which are present within player from the start, and are pretty much **UNIQUE** for every
player.

Currently there only 3 types of innerlights, Heal Light, Defense Light and Strength Light. For now, when they trigger they add a powerful potion effect (beyond vanilla levels) when the player (or the target of the light) needs it the most. Aka, for now, when they are below 25/50% depending on the specif light.
But this is just a start, i'm going to make more complex lights with more complex triggers that may summon a raging storm at whover is attacking the player or his allies, or ice up the surroundings and such. I just don't have the time right now, and besides, this is just the alpha version!

The duration, power, the cooldown and other similar things are all based on the players uuid and they differ quite a bit from each other! Although the type can alter this to make it a bit better (in theory you could get a duration 1 "trait" but it wouldn't really makes sense so there is a minimum duration depending on the light type)

Of course the LightType and Target of the light are determined with the UUID as well.

# SPOILERS AHED: If you want to discover the features of this mod yourself (which is better in my opinion since it's intened to be something like "Oh no i'm gonna lose, but wait something within me is magicly helping me" like a main character of an anime) DO NOT LOOK AT THE LIGHT TYPES UNDER HERE. SKIP TO THE BERRIES IF YOU WANT!

### The light types:
#### Heal
If a player has this light when he gets attacked
*Trivia: This was the first light that was developed*
