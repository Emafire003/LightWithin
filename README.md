# Light Within Mod

## So... What does it do?

This mod adds a new mechanic, called "InnerLights" which are present within player from the start, and are pretty much *UNIQUE* for every
player.

Currently there only 3 types of innerlights, Heal Light, Defense Light and Strength Light. For know, all they do when they trigger is adding a potion effect (beyond vanilla levels) when the player (or the target of the light) needs it the most. Aka, for now, when they are below 25/50% depending on the specif light.
