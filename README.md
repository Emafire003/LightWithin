# LightWithin Mod

## WIP, I am rewrtiting most of the stuff.

This mod adds a new mechanic, called *"InnerLights"* which are cool fancy magicalish powers present within player, and they are pretty much **UNIQUE** for every single
player.

![demo_heal_brief](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29462910/171922554-e776af80-241a-4acc-a5f8-1d0b3f26211c.gif)

There a lots of lights, ranging from granting potent status effects like healing, to freezing all of your enemies on the spot, or even save your allies from falling from great heights by flying away! You can even summon creatures to defend yourself against dangers!
Each light has a cool sound design and distinct effects, with particle, custom glowing effects, and misterious runes appearing on your screen!

And all of this is different from player to player, so everyone will have their personal secret power!

You can look at the video/images below or check the wiki for demos of these lights. Or you could preserve the surprise and just play with the mod and find out yourself!

/////A fex example images go here //////

## How is it unique?

The lights are uniquely determined by the player's UUID, a set of bits that are generated by the game and assigned to every entity for uniquly identify it. 

There a few things that contribute to the uniqueness of a light: 
- First and foremost, it's **TYPE**, which could for example be HEAL, FROST, or BLAZING or whatever. This correspond to which category/type your light is from
- Then, there is the **TARGET**. This specifies what your light targets, aka who will be affected by the triggering of the light. It could be ENEMIES, ALLIES, SELF etc
- Starting with some numerical values we have the **POWER** of your light, which determines how strong your light is. It is a value used in calculating a Status Effect level, the damage done when activating the light and so on
- We have the **DURATION**, which, unsurpisingly specifies how much your light remains active
- Lastly we have the **COOLDOWN** duration, which is how much time will need to pass between activating your light again! Your light will need some rest after spending all that energy no?
//maybe bisect here?
// add something that with a graph some kind of example of the values above

## How can I activate them?
In order to activate them you need to met specific conditions, which often vary between light types. Usually, it involves fighting with another mob/enemy player and being "in danger", for example on low health, or being surrounded by many enemies. To be more precise usally you need to meet more than one condition in order to trigger the activation. In my opinion it's better to just discover how to activate your light by playing, so I won't go in further detail here, look at the wiki instead.

Once you have met these conditions, an icon ![Senza titolo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29462910/171919382-d65f6f72-4a84-44f9-9ebb-62283755793e.png) will appear in the top left corner signaling that your light is ready to be released. Press the keybind **V** (default, you can change it) and activate your light!

// ADD a gif of the icon appearing and also the light triggering//

There is also a magical item called **Luxintus Berry** which lets you activate the light regardless of the conditions. It's kind of an energy drink for your inner light! Another 2 "Lux" berry are present, allowing you to change your light type and knowing which light type you have without needing to trigger it or use commands. (Check the wiki for more info!)

/// RANDOM STUFF FROM THE OLD README, WIP//
## The "Lux" Berries
They currently can't be obtained in survival, and when they will there are going to range in rarity from the golden apple to beyond the enchanted one.

![berries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29462910/171917861-fd2f614a-b691-4a2b-b596-eabe64e2ff65.gif)

*From left to right, Luxmuta Berry, Luxintus Berry, Luxcognita Berry*

### Luxmutua Berry ![luxmut_berry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29462910/171920401-c0134016-6a9f-453d-8f4b-2afad5165b17.png)

This one, will mix up your innerlight, allowing you to change it innerlight. The change is random, and it won't be the same one you had before eating it. It also changed the target randomly. This is probably going to be even more rare that an enchanted golden apple

### Luxintus Berry ![sweet_berries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29462910/171920163-2cdb1586-ded6-47ba-97ea-0d259be72187.png)

This magical berry will refill your inner light, and trigger it right away. It will be as rare as an enchanted golden apple
*Trivia: First berry to have developed, and the only one originally planned*

### Luxcognita Berry ![luxcogni](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29462910/171920418-17c52b5a-0fa5-497b-94a8-7e5d3ea7c3c4.png) 

This berry will read your innerlight, and tell you how it's made up, aka what does it do, before activating it. It will be useful once the mod is out of alpha... eheh. Anyway, it will be as rare as a normal golden apple. Maybe you could find it in the same places too.
