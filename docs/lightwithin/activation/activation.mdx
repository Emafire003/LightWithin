# How to activate your InnerLight
No need to find nirvana or anything.
Mostly, it boils down to: The light activates on its own, you just have the press the **V** button in order to release it! But, lets get a little more in depth.
From version 1.1.0 you are able to activate your light on-demand using [Light Charges](lightcharges) as well, with some drawbacks tho. For more info look at the [dedicated page](activation/lightcharges).

You can tell when your light is ready to activate because you will see this icon on your screen: <Asset location="lightwithin:lights/light" title="Light ready icon"/>

## When is a light ready to activate?
The mod listen to events and situations that would put the player in danger. If a certain situation has enough "conditions" (see below) are met, the light is made ready for the player, and an icon (<Asset location="lightwithin:lights/light" title="Light ready icon"/>) will pop up on the screen!
At this point you can choose to activate your light by pressing the **V** keybind But be quick, you don't have forever to press that button!

### Conditions
The [conditions](triggers) can be factors of even more danger for a player or "catalysts" for that player's light type.
These all have different weights, and contribute to a threshold which if surpassed, allows the activation of the light.
The combination of all the different conditions vary between light types and even from one target type to the other, so please check them out in the page of each light. Or discover them through playing!

Some light types require your [ALLIES](../light_targets/allies) (faction/team/guild/party members) to be in these dangerous situations, but the triggers are the same, although they may use different numbers for the allies, configurable in the config file.

You can find a list of the triggers in the [next page](triggers)!

### Using a Luxintus berry
There is a rare item that you can find in loot chests called [Luxintus Berry](../items_and_misc/luxberries) <Asset location="lightwithin:item/luxintus" title="Luxintus berry"/>, which allows you to instantly activate your light after you have finished eating it.
