## Clear Ice
The clear ice a custom block spawned with the Frost Light, and it's similar to the Frosted Ice, spawned when using the Frost Walker enchantment. In fact, it will melt after the light of the caster has worn off, and it will leave beahind a little puff of snow particles. It is also highly transparent to let you see who or what is trapped into the ice, and is also trasparent, so entities won't suffocate inside it. It cannot be obtained in survival.

## Ice wall
A transparent wall, that spawns with the Frost Light with the target of Allies and Self. And that's it.

## Ice statue blocks
These were originally part of the Frost Light, but they now are discontinued, since Clear Ice those the same job much better. I've left them for decoration purposes, at least in Creative mode. There is still a piece present in game, the top part of the player ice statue. It is positioned on the ice wall from the Frost Light with the target types of Allies or Self.
