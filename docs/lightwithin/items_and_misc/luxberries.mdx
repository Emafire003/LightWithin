### Luxmutua Berry <Asset location="lightwithin:item/luxmutua" title="Luxmutua"/>

This one, will "mix up" your innerlight, allowing you to change your light (from version 2.0.0 all of the attributes change, in earlier versions only the type would). The change is random, and it won't be the same one you had before eating it. It is very rare.

### Luxintus Berry <Asset location="lightwithin:item/luxintus" title="Luxintus"/>

This magical berry will replenish, or even saturate, your InnerLight, and it will trigger it right away, regardless of the cooldown or the conditions needed to activate it.

You can use it make the **Luxintus Berry Powder** which you can use to brew a Bottled Light artificially!

*Trivia: First berry to have developed, and the only one originally planned*

### Luxcognita Berry <Asset location="lightwithin:item/luxcognita" title="Luxcognita"/>

This berry will read your InnerLight, and tell you its secrets. When you eat a magical screen will open, and you will be able to get information on what type of InnerLight you have, what target, and their respective ingredients to be used in Bottled Light brewing!
