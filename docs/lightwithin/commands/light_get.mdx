## /light get < attribute > < target >
**Permission required:** `lightwithin.commands.get`

With this command you can get information of a player's light attributes. The first argument can be:
- `all` which is going to give you information on all the attributes. It will also tell the unmodified/original values of each attribute.
- `type` of the light
- `target` of the light
- `power` of the light
- `duration` of the light
- `cooldown` of the light
- `locked` status of the light
- `hasNaturallyTriggered` status of the light
- `max_charges` of the light

- `lights` gives you info about the currently usable lights. (Deprecated, will remove it probably)

The second argument is a player.
