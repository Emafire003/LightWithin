## /light reroll < target > < attribute >
**Permission required:** `lightwithin.commands.reroll`

This command allows you to randomly change the `target`'s attributes, by generating a random uuid and calculating the new light attributes base on that. You can use:
- `all` to reroll everything, type, target etc.
- `type` to reroll the light type (if the new type does not have the old target available a new one will be generated)
- `target` to reroll the ligh target available for the current light type
- `typeTarget` to reroll both the type and the target.
- `power` to reroll the power of the light
- `duration` to reroll the duration of the light
- `cooldown` to reroll the cooldown of the light
- `max_charges` to reroll max number of light charges
