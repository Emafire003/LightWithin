## /light reset < target > [ confirm ]
**Permission required:** `lightwithin.commands.reset`

This commands will reset all of the light attributes of the target, by getting their uuid and re-calculating the attributes based on that. To prevent accidents, you will need to type the command again and `confirm` at the end of the command.

This is useful if you mess around with the light set command or if the mod updates and adds a new light type and you want to see if the targets light ha changed.
