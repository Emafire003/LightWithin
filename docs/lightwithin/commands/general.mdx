There are a handful of useful commands that you or a server admin can use to do various things, such as setting specific light type and target power etc, or rerolling for a new one.

# Commands in general
They all start with either `/light` or `/lightwithin` and each commands needs a permission to be run, or if you prefer you can grant the `lightwhithin.commands` permission to allow someone to use every commands. Otherwise they would need to be an Operator to use the commands.

All commands support tab-completion in game and are quite intuitive, so you could just play around with them in game in order to understand how they work.

In this guide I will use the /light alias.
