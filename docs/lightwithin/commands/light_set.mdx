## /light set < attribute > < target > < attribute_value >
**Permission required:** `lightwithin.commands.set`

With this command you can set a light attribute for a player to a specific value. You can change:
- The `type` of the light
- The `target` of the light, but only if it's available for that light. (For example you can't set VARIANT to BLAZING)
- The `power` of the light, limited between 1 and 10
- The `duration` of the light, minimum 1
- The `max_cooldown` of the light, limited between 1-120
- The `locked` status of the light. If set to true, the player won't be able to activate the light no matter what.
- The `hasNaturallyTriggered` status of the light. If set to true, the player will be able to use LightCharges, if false they will first need to trigger their light in a natural way. After they have done that, they will be able to use LightCharges.
- The `max_charges` of the light, limited between 0-9

The first argument is one of the values above, the second one it's the target of this change and can be a player or multiple ones. The third one is the value you want the new attribute to have.
