title: LightWithin Commands

## /light ready < target > [ delay ]
**Permission required:** `lightwithin.commands.ready`

This commands allows you to force-ready a light of a player, the `target`, bypassing cooldown and other restrictions. Optionally, you can add a `delay` in seconds after which the light will force activate. This differs from the activate commands because the player still needs to press the button to activate the power.
