This mod adds a new mechanic, called *"InnerLights"* which are cool fancy magicalish powers present within the player, and they are pretty much **UNIQUE** for every single
one of them! And you can't just spam them, they will only help you if your are in danger! It is also highly configurable, and multiplayer friendly!

There are lots of lights, ranging from ones that grant powerful status effects like healing, to freezing all of your enemies on the spot, or even save your allies from falling from great heights by flying away! You can even summon creatures to defend yourself against dangers!
Each light has a cool sound design and distinct effects, with particles, custom glowing effects, and runes appearing on your screen!

And all of this is different from player to player, so everyone will have their personal secret power!

## How is it unique?
You can look [here](light_structure) for more info!
The lights are uniquely determined by the player's UUID, a set of bits that are generated by the game and assigned to every entity to uniquly identify it, a bit like fingerprints or DNA.

There a few things that contribute to the uniqueness of a light, called attributes:
- First and foremost, it's **TYPE**, which could be HEAL, FROST, or BLAZING or whatever. This corresponds to which category/type your light is from. It's the main "ingredient"
- Then, there is the **TARGET**. This specifies what your light targets, aka who will be affected by the triggering of the light. It could be ENEMIES, ALLIES, SELF etc
- Starting with some numerical values we have the **POWER** of your light, which determines how strong your light is. It is a value used in calculating a Status Effect level, the damage done when activating the light and so on. It ranges from 1 to 10.
- We have the **DURATION**, which, unsurprisingly specifies how much your light remains active
- Lastly we have the **COOLDOWN** duration, which is how much time will need to pass between activating your light again! Your light will need some rest after spending all that energy no?

## How can I activate them?
Look [here](activation/activation)

## Compatibility and Hooks with other mods
This mod is compatible with [ColoredGlowLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/coloredglowlib) to add a custom glow color while the light is active.
For the Allies or Enemies you can use Faction, OPAC, Argonauts, FTBTeams and Minecraft's teams.
You can also use Flan and YetAnotherWorldProtector to enable/disable light activation in certain areas.

There are no currently know incompatibilities with other mods. Let me know if you find any!
