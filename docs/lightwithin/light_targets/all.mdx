*BottledLight ingredient*: `minecraft:allium`

This targets every entity, except the player, usually. It can do damage to nearby entities, or summon a big structure or some mobs.
In general it's something that effects everyone but the caster in some ways or another. This means there is no protection from the caster's action for their allies.

Also, ahah all-ium as in ingredient very funny eh?
