*BottledLight ingredient*: `minecraft:nether_wart`

This targets the caster's enemies, which are defined by:
- Being Hostile Entities that are not summoned by the caster or are their ALLIES (look in allies page for more info). So for example an Husk that is in your team is considered as an ally and won't be counted as an enemy
- Being in an Enemy faction or team (see allies page for mod compatibility)
- In the config you can specify if not being an Ally equals being an enemy. If so, every entity that is not a caster's ally will be considered as an enemy

Generally the targets are damaged by the caster's light triggering, in some form or another.
