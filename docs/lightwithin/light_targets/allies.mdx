This affects the caster's Allies, which are defined by:
- Being a vanilla team member (using the /team command in vanila)
- Being the caster's pet (like wolfs and cats, even modded ones if they extend TamableEntity)
- Being in the same Faction, from the [Factions mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/factions)
- Being in mutually allied factions
- Being in the same Guild, from the [Argonauts mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/argonauts)
- Being in the same Party, from the Argonauts mod as well
- Being in the same Party, from the [OPAC mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims)
- Being in allied parties, from the OPAC mod as well
- Being in the same Team, from the FTB Teams mod
- Being in allied Party / the same party, from the FTB Teams mod

The caster is also included in the ALLIES target but they usually don't receive buffs as strong as their allies (if they were, it would be just a SELF+ which I didn't really like)
