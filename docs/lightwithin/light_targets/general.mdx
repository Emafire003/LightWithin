title: General information on light targets
---
These are the targets of your light. Every light has a few of this available and they shape which effect that particular light type will have, and most importantly who or what it will target.
Not every light has every type of target, typically they have between 2 and 4. Moreover they have a different chances of appearing, with the chances being as follows:
- 5 possible target types: 39% 21% 16% 14% 8%
- 4 possible target types: 48% 21% 16% 14%
- 3 possible target types: 48% 35.5% 16%
- 2 possible target types: 64% 35.6%
- And well, 100% for 1 target type

Some lights may repeat a target type in the order, to modify the chance. For example, in ThunderAura the VARIANT target type is much rarer than the other two.
