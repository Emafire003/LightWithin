# Client config files
### Filename: `lightwithin_client.yml`
Client side config which manages display settings like the postion of rendered items on screen like the runes and the light icons. Can be edited in game using [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl). Here you can find a copy updated to 1.2.0:
Note: you can't manually change the presets, you will need to use YACL to do that. But you can still change the x,y values.
