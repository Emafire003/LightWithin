# Trigger config file
### Filename: `lightwithin_trigger_balancing.yml`
Server side config which manages the trigger threshold and the weights of each condition of each light target and type. Here you can find a copy updated to 1.2.0:

```yaml

version:3
#The threshold to reach in order to activate a light | default= 5 | type= Integer
trigger_threshold:5

#This config file lets you modify how the lights trigger. Be very careful if you really want to change this!
