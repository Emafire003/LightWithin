**Possible Target Types:** `SELF`, `ALL`

**Trigger actions**: Attacking, Getting Attacked, Ally dying

**BottledLight ingredient**: `minecraft:oak_sapling`

**Conditions:**
- **`SELF`**: `Low Health`, `Very low Health`, `Ally low health`, `Surrounded`, `Being near leaves`, `ForestAura conditions`
- **`ALL`**: `Low Health`, `Very low Health`, `Surrounded`, `Harmful status effect`, `ForestAura conditions`

ForestAura conditions:
- Being in a forest/taiga/jungle biome
- Holding a sapling (any type)

**Effect:**
- **`SELF`**: Upon activation you will get the ForestAura effect, which will allow you to pass through forest blocks, like wood leaves and podzol (defined in a tag list)! You can shift to go down and jump to go up, like in a scaffolding block.
You won't suffocate (as long as the effect is active), but you won't be able to see clearly either. You will however see entities near you with borders highlighted. The number of entities you will be able to see is 3 + your power level. If you have ColoredGlowLib installed, you will also be able to see these entities highlighted in green
If your power level is above 5 (exclusive) you will also be able to distinguish enemies, as they will appear red. If above 7 (exclusive) you will also see your allies in a blue-green color.
- **`ALL`**: When activated a number _"ForestPuffs"_ equal to 2 + your power level + a bonus if you power level is above five (half your power level) will be spawned around the player at a configurable range. (So between 3 and 17).
These puffs appear as bursts of colored particle effects, and each color corresponds to a potion effect that will be applied to nearby entities, with one exception: **other players with ForestAura light type won't be affected**.
The total duration of the effects applied is distributed between the puffs in a random way. The total duration is the light's duration multiplier by 1.2 by default, but configurable in main config.
Above power level 5 more types and colors of puffs are available. Check the table below. An important effect is Intoxication, which will display intoxicated-like shaders on the screen as well as randomize the controls and making the player jump randomly.
The way the controls are randomized varies between power levels.
