**Effect:**
- **`ENEMIES`**: When activated, nearby enemies will be set on fire, damaged by fire of an amount equal to the Blazing base damage multiplied by the player's power multiplier. The terrain beneath the caster will be burnt, and a structure will spawn representing the burnt terrain, unless the structure spawning is turned off in the config. The player will receive the Fire Resistance effect for a duration equal to their light's duration. Both the player and the targets will be engulfed by Blazing light particles.
Moreover, there is chance (10%) to make a critical hit. If this happens, the target is set on fire for more time and will receive more damage (configurable in the config file). A fire ring will also appear around the player, and a column of fire particles will spawn on the targets. A custom audio will also be played.

- **`ALL`**: Same as ENEMIES, but the damage done is more, configurable as well. It also targets everyone in the radius, and not just the enemies so watch out!
