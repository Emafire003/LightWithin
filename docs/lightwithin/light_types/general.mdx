title: General information on the light types
---
These are the core of the light and the mod, they are the main abilities that you activate and correspond to much of the fancy things happening around you (along with the different target types).
Because of this, I suggest that instead of reading trough this you just play with the mod, and find out which light you have by "randomly" triggering it while playing. At least that's how it would work in my head.

### Conditions and triggers
Each light type has its own _conditions_ and _triggers_ to meet. Each light type (except the status effect ones) also has its special conditions, which usually are required to trigger the light. They usually involve holding a particular item or standing next to some blocks, and are configurable using tags and a datapack.

### Bottled Light ingredients
Each light has its own unique ingredient to brew a corresponding BottledLight. These ingredients are usually items like a Golden Apple, a Wind charge or something related to that light type's effects. You can view them by eating a LuxCognita Berry in game.trigger

### Target types
Of course each light has its "subtype", determined by its target type. Each light type typically has at least 2 target types.
